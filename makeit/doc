-= MAKEIT =-

- Goals:
	- To generate native Makefiles for the system `makeit' is running on.
	  To accomplish that, we transform a set of `Makefile' fragments and
	  module config files into a non-recursive Makefile that uses features
	  available to all reasonable versions of Make (GNU, BSD, SVR4, etc).

	- If `makeit' can be called a build system, it should stay so small and
	  platform independent that it could be included in each project that
	  it helps to build.

	- There is no need to build or install `makeit'. It's ready to run via
	  `config' to produce a `Makefile' ready to build the guest project via
	  `make'.  That's it !

- `module (*.mconf)' Keywords:
	- name : name of the module, just a handle
	- prog : name of a program to link
	- lib : name of a library to create, without the 'lib' prefix
	- asrc : list of (.S) assembly source files
	- csrc : list of C source files to build
	- win_asrc : windows only list of C source files to build
	- win_csrc : windows only list of C source files to build
	- unix_asrc : unix only list of C source files to build
	- unix_csrc : unix only list of C source files to build
	- depends : list of module "name"s that a prog or a lib depends on
	- cflags : list of CFLAGS to add for this module
	- ldflags : list of LDFLAGS to add for this module
	- extralibs : list of extra libs needed by the program (e.g., -lgcc)
	- extrainstall : list of extra files to install

- Implementation:
	- Should only use POSIX portable tools : m4, awk, sh.
