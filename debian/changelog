  * New upstream release
    - Fixed an issue for support of older distributions and kernels
      with regards to the setns() function
    - Fixed autofs bug path
  * Get source package's version using /usr/share/dpkg/pkg-info.mk
    instead of calling dpkg-parsechangelog in debian/rules. This is
    possible since dpkg >= 1.16.1.

singularity-container (2.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fresh upstream minor release
    - A potential escalation pathway was identified that could have
    allowed a malicious user to escalate their privileges on hosts that do not
    support the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS flag for the prctl() system call. This
    release fixes this as well as several other identified bugs and potential
    race conditions.

singularity-container (2.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fresh upstream minor release
  * debian/patches -- all dropped (upstreamed)
  * debian/copyright -- updated copyright holders/years
  * debian/rules
    - a few path tune ups for permissions tuning as introduced upstream
    - apparently still uses /var as default for localstatedir, so specified
      /var/lib explicitly
    - export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR env var to instruct singularity
      to not attempt create cachedir somewhere under /nonexistent path
      Also added a patch to not fail to create that cache directory if 
      parent doesn't exist
  * debian/control
    - Python to build-depends

singularity-container (2.2-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * debian/patches - picks up from upcoming 2.2.1 release

    - changeset_b859cd8b4b9293f2a8a893ef41c5d93a5318dd6c.diff

    - changeset_d835fa1d20efc4aaacca4be68431d193d6625bd8.diff
      to fix bootstrapping ran as root (thus no MS_NODEV restriction

    - changeset_3a2b6537f0b1386336e29d7f763ae62374a7cb77.diff

singularity-container (2.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Mehdi Dogguy ]
  * Team upload.
  * New upstream release.
    - Install sexec-suid utility instead of sexec
  * Add a override_dh_auto_test in debian/rules to skip testsuite which
    is not well-suited for auto-builders.

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * debian/control
    - Vcs- fields adjusted to point to https://anonscm.debian.org/git
    - Mehdi to uploaders
    - Depends on python since some python scripts are used
  * Enforce world readable permissions for /var/singularity{,/mnt{,/source}}
    directories (needed since 2.2)
  * debian/patches
    - 000*-*py* - to not install not to be executed python modules as scripts
    - 000*-bash* - bash completions script has bashisms
  * debian/rules
    - bash completion script under /usr/share/bash-completion/completions
  * use /var/lib/singularity (instead of FHS-noncompliant /var/singularity)
    Next upstream release will adhere to this location as well.
    Previously used location /var/singularity is left untouched -- inspect
    and cleanup.
