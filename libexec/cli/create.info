******************************************************************************
NOTICE: The create command is deprecated and will be removed in a later version 
        of Singularity.  create now uses image.create to create a writable 
        container via the following syntax:

$ singularity image.create container.img

        It is no longer necessary to create and bootstrap an image in 2 
        seperate commands. You should use the build command to create and 
        bootstrap your image in a single step.
